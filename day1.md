## Keynote

### From Grassroots to Green Pastures: Freedom of Choice and the Era of Integrated Computing
Speaker: [Christos Giorgiopoulos](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/christos_georgiopoulos.html), Intel

What is a hardware company doing at html5 conf?

* Intel does a lot of software too
* Commitment to an open cross platform community

#### Three Eras of Computing

* Task-Based
* Lifestyle
* Integrated

##### Task Based

Mainframes doing tasks. Punchcards. Very scarce resource.

##### Lifestyle

PC Era moved us into lifestyle computing. Moores law. Put notebooks, tablets, etc. into the hands of people. 

Device centric.

##### Integrated

Computing becomes seamlessly integrated with our lifestyle. Less about the device, more about what the user is trying to accomplish.

This type of computing has to solve problems that we haven't tried to solve.

#### 50 Billion Devices / Freedom of Choice

Rich diversity between devices, OS's.

System Oriented Arch. (SOC). Modular hardware components packaged into devices. 

Multiple OS's on these devices. Developer has a big challenge to deliver a seamless user experience because of this diversity.

We need open cross platform technologies in order to run our programs seamlessly.

#### Gartner Hype Cycle

1. Tech Trigger
2. Peak of Inflated Expectations
3. Trough of Disillusionment
4. Slope of Enlightenment
5. Plateau of Productivity

#### HTML5

Developing into a widely used standard language. Saves time, don't have to write/re-compile for different devices.
Less time developing, more time marketing.

Will not and cannot replace everything. There is still a place for native programming.
But HTML5 has to become the foundation for application creation.

A complete solution requires an open cloud + cross platform tools.

#### Misc.

Intel is a huge contributor to Linux, Chrome, and Android.

Intel XDK New? Test emulate and build for multiple OS/Platforms.

Adobe Brackets Editor?

#### Smart Notify

Sounds like scripted dialog. They used XDK, then moved away because they started using phonegap.

#### Live.ly

Did not use XDK. Needed to deal with DRM video/audio and needed to stream directly to native client.

#### Lost Decade Games 

Using tools like [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) to wrap html5 games into native apps. helps with monitization.

Mobile game with [cocoon.js](http://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs). 

#### [HTML Hub](http://html5hub.com/)

HTML5 community for developers.
